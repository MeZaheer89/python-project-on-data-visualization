# 🎬 Capstone Project: Online Movie Rating Bias Analysis  
**Python for Machine Learning & Data Science**

## 📌 Project Overview
This project was completed as part of a **Python for Machine Learning & Data Science certification**.  
It focuses on analyzing the reliability of online movie ratings, particularly when the platform displaying those ratings also profits from ticket sales.

The analysis investigates whether Fandango exhibited a bias by inflating movie ratings to encourage higher ticket sales.

## ❓ Problem Statement
How reliable are online movie ratings especially when the platform displaying them also benefits financially from ticket purchases?

This project examines:
- Whether displayed star ratings differ from true user ratings  
- How ratings compare across multiple platforms after normalization  

---

## 🛠️ Key Tasks & Analysis Performed
- Data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Correlation analysis between movie ratings and vote counts  
- Comparison of displayed vs. true user ratings on Fandango  
- Distribution analysis using KDE plots and histograms  
- Cross-platform rating comparison after normalizing all scores to a 0–5 scale  
- Identification of movies with the largest rating discrepancies  
- Visualization of worst-rated movies versus displayed star ratings

## ⚙️ Skills & Tools Used
- Python (Data Analysis & Visualization)  
- Pandas & NumPy  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn  
- Statistical comparison and normalization techniques  

---

## 📊 Results & Insights
- Fandango consistently displayed higher ratings than true user averages  
- Poorly rated movies on other platforms often appeared with 3.5–4.5 stars  
- This suggests a systematic upward bias rather than random variation
